# Calculator
The program is a simple calculator implemented in Java. The program reads input from the user and asks them to enter two numbers and a factor (either '+', '-', '*', or '/'). Then the program performs the required operation and prints the result. If the operator is invalid, the program prints an “Invalid Operators” message.
